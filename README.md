# Clustering RFM and forecasting with PySpark

A Strategic Approach to Marketing for Unique Customer
Groups and Forecasting. 

Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses looking to better understand and target their customer base. It allows you to group customers with similar characteristics or behaviors together, which can inform various business goals and solutions.

**What is RFM and why company should classify RFM of their customer?** 

RFM is a basic customer segmentation algorithm based on their purchasing behaviour. The behaviour is identified by using only three customer data points:

- **Recency**: How recently has each customer made a purchase?
- **Frequency**: How often have they bought something?
- **Monetary Value**: How much money do they spend on average when making purchases?


These metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affect a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement. Here are some reasons why RFM is crucial for creating customer segmentation:

    1. Objective Analysis: RFM utilizes objective, numerical scales that yield a concise and informative high-level depiction of customers.
    2. Simplicity: It is simple – marketers can use it effectively without the need for data scientists or sophisticated software.
    3. Intuitiveness: The output of this segmentation method is easy to understand and interpret2.
    4. Targeted Marketing: RFM analysis allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior. This can generate much higher rates of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value2.
    5. Customer Understanding: Smart marketers understand the importance of “know thy customer.” Instead of simply focusing on generating more clicks, marketers must follow the paradigm shift from increased CTRs (Click-Through Rates) to retention, loyalty, and building customer relationships1.
    6. Homogeneous Customer Groups: Instead of analyzing the entire customer base as a whole, it’s better to segment them into homogeneous groups, understand the traits of each group, and engage them with relevant campaigns rather than segmenting on just customer age or geography1.

In summary, RFM helps divide customers into various categories or clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services3. It takes into account multiple aspects of customer behavior, rather than just one3, making it a powerful tool for customer segmentation.
